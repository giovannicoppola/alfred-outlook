# alfred-outlookSuite
***A suite of tools to interact with Microsoft Outlook via Alfred***



- *Note*: Many of the functions of this package will not work with the new, electron-based, 'New Outlook' interface, as AppleScript is not supported. Uncheck `New Outlook` in the `File` menu in Outlook to switch to the previous version.

<h1 id="setting-up">Setting up ‚öôÔ∏è</h1>

### Needed
- Alfred 5 with Powerpack license
- *Note*: Many of the functions of this pacage Will not work with the 'New Outlook' interface, as AppleScript is not supported. 
- *Note*: Your institution might have an automatic archival policy. In that case older mail messages that have been archived will not be returned in alfred-outlookSuite queries
- Python3 (howto [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/))
- Download `alfred-outlookSuite` [latest release](https://github.com/giovannicoppola/alfred-outlookSuite/releases/latest)



## Default settings 
- In Alfred, open the 'Configure Workflow' menu in `alfred-outlookSuite` preferences
- *Optional*:	
	- set the keyword (or hotkey) to launch `alfred-outlookSuite` (default: `olk`) 
	- set the keyword (or hotkey) to force-refresh the folder list (default: `outlook::refresh`)
	- set your name, so that it can be used in `from:me` and `to:me` searches
	- *Text to hide in subject* Enter here comma-separated text strings that you don't want to see in the 'Subject' result (e.g. [External], <External> etc.), therefore saving important real estate in Alfred's output.
	- *Folders to exclude* List here, comma-separated, the folders you would like to exclude from the search. Default: `Deleted Items`. 
	- *Folders list refresh rate*	- The folder list is generated periodically (default: 30 days) to improve performance, as folders change less often. Enter your preferred number of days here.
	- *Snooze file location* - Leave empty if you use this Workflow on one computer (it will be saved in the Workflow's data folder). Enter a shared folder location here in case you want to share the file snoozing information across computers using the same Outlook account.


<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage üìñ</h1>

## Search your email üîç

- standard search: one or more search strings will search both the subject of an email, and its preview (first 250 characters). 
- gmail-like search strings, listed below, supported (remember to set the MYSELF variable in the Workflow COnfiguration. 
	- `from:` (including `from:me`)
	- `to:` (including `to:me`)
	- `subject:`, `cc:`, `has:attach`, `is:unread`, `is:read`, `is:important`, `is:unimportant`  
	- `folder:` (note: replace spaces with underscores if the folder name contains spaces, e.g. `folder:sent_items`
	- `-text` to exclude text 
	- `--a` to sort by increasing date (oldest first)
	- `since:n` will return email received in the last `n` days. `w` and `m` are supported for months and weeks, respectively (e.g. `since:2w`)

## Draft a new email ‚≠ê
- use a keyword (default: `em`) or a hotkey to launch, followed by text. Alfred will create a draft email with subject =  entered text, and save it  in the `Drafts` folder. 

## Email Saving üíæ
- use a keyword (default: `ols`) or a hotkey to launch, while Outloook is the frontomost application and an email is selected. 
- Shoose the destination folder using Alfred's file filter
- Save your email there. File will be renamed to include date and exclude special characters. A Markdown link to that email is copied to the clipboard. 



## Email Snoozing üí§
- Make sure you have, or create, a `Snoozed` folder in your main Outlook account. 
- use a keyword (default: `olz`) or a hotkey to launch, while Outloook is the frontomost application and an email is selected. 
- enter the number of days you want to snooze your email. Alfred will show the corresponding date, and the number of emails already snoozed for that date. 
- Selecting the result will 1) Snooze the email until the desired date and 2) move that email to the `Snoozed` folder. 
- the `checkSnoozed` keyword will show in large font (and copy to clipboard) an overview of all the snoozed email (one line per day) 
- Unsnoozing will happen once a day, as soon as `alfred-outlookSuite` is launched. You can force the unsnooze script using a keyword (default: `olu` or a hotkey). 


## Folder database refresh üîÑ
- will occur according to the rate in days set in `alfred-outlookSuite` preferences
- `outlook::refresh` to force folder database refresh


<h1 id="known-issues">Limitations & known issues ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1>

- None for now, but I have not done extensive testing, let me know if you see anything!
- Again, a lot of this will not work with the electron interface (`New Outlook`). Uncheck `New Outlook` in the `File` menu in Outlook to switch to the previous version.
